# Introduction
Welcome to the official Basilisk guide! Here, you will learn the fundamentals of Basilisk and create your first application using the engine.

## What is Basilisk?
We should start with a quick overview of what Basilisk is and what it can be used for. Basilisk is a 3D engine package for python that can create visualizations, simulations, and video games from the comfort and ease of Python. Basilisk is designed for quick and effortless development with a powerful backend engine that supports larger scaled projects. Our engine automatically handles all graphics and physics for you, with the option to inject your own functionality if desired.

## Prerequisites
This guide assumes you know the fundamentals of Python and object oriented programming. If you have that, then you are ready to go! Graphics knowledge is helpful for more advanced Basilisk functionality, but it is certainly not required.

## Structure
This guide will create a simple Basilisk project, introducing topics of intrest on each page. For more specific and in-depth information about the topics and modules that will be convered in this guide, see the reference section of the docs.
